# About R

- R is a programming language for statistics (computing and visualisation)
- For a brief history of R, go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)>

# Download and install R

- Go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
- Download the version of R for your operating system:
  Windows, Mac, or Linux
- The installation file will then get downloaded:
  .pkg on a Mac, or .exe on Windows, people with Linux know what 
  they're doing
- Follow the instructions for installation
- **There is no need to run R** (you'll know why in a jiffy)

# About RStudio

- RStudio is an 
  **IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R**
- For more about RStudio, go to:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio>

# Download and install RStudio

- Go to: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
- Scroll down, there will be multiple versions offered
- You want **“RStudio desktop - Free”**
- Click to download 
- Install following instructions
- **Now we are ready to run RStudio**

# If you run RStudio, you should see this

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "80%", out.extra='style="float:center; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics('../pics/RStudio_IDE.png')
```

# Two adjustments

- **Open** the options window: *Cmd+* on a Mac or go to *Tools* 
  and then all the way down to *Global Options*
- **Uncheck** “Restore .RData into workspace on startup” 
- **Set** “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”


# Additional adjustments?

- If you want to export .pdf files for your assignment submissions, you will need to **install some R packages**
- To do this, you need to run up to three lines in your console (the part on the left you see when you first open RStudio)
- **Do not do this now; do it when you have a few minutes to wait for the installation to finish**

# Additional adjustments (cont'd)?

- The first line is:\
    install.packages( "tidyverse")\
- Then, remember if you have LaTeX already installed on your computer
- If you do, you're done
- If you don't, then run:\
    install.packages("tinytex")\
- Then, you run:\
    tinytex::install_tinytex()\
    
# HELP!

- Google is your best friend!
- Within the console you can type:\
  help("command")\
  or\
  ?command

# Now we play ...
