### Course info

**Course Description.** M362M is an undergraduate 
course on stochastic processes and
applications. We focus on several classes of elementary stochastic
processes which are often used in various applications such as random walks,
discrete Markov chains and, time permitting, the
Poisson process and Brownian motion. The course will promote the 
generative approach to probability and the use of computer simulations.

**Learning Objectives.**

- Students will get acquainted
with mathematical tools and techniques, as well as the probabilistic
intuition necessary for understanding and successful use of stochastic
models in a variety of applications within mathematics and in science,
engineering, economics, etc. They will also learn how to build new
models, in yet-unencountered situations and novel frameworks. 

- Students will become familiar 
with the basics of the programming language R and the RStudio IDE. They will 
learn how to use R to simulate random variables and stochastic processes. Those skills will 
allow them to answer a much wider spectrum of questions about the behavior of
stochastic processes, compared to a purely analytic approach. 


**Prerequisites.** The formal prerequisite is the grade B or better in
M362K. Students are
assumed to be at home with the basics of probability as presented in,
e.g., Ross's [First Course in Probability](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Ross-First-Course-in-Probability-A-9th-Edition/PGM110742.html), Pitman's [Probability](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387979748) or Asimow and Maxwell's [Probability and Statistics with Applications](https://books.google.com/books/about/Probability_and_Statistics_with_Applicat.html?id=ZL3QQZsp6DAC);
there will be a brief review. Also, a good working knowledge of calculus
and basic linear algebra is assumed; no review will be given.

Students are not assumed to have any prior programming experience and 
the basics of R will be covered from scratch. 

**Class format and online attendance.** With the class being completely online, and given its strong computational flavor, the class will be delivered in a somewhat "flipped" format. The students will get assigned reading before most classes, and a short quiz on the assigned content will be administered (see below for details). The class time will be used to answer student questions, clarify content and work in groups on additional exercises. The students are encouraged to use the tag *topic_suggestions* on Piazza to suggest topics and problems from their assigned reading they would like to see explained during the next class meeting. 

**Textbook.**
There is no required textbook. Lecture notes written by the instructor
will be posted online (the link will be provided on Canvas). The students in need of an additional source
of problems (or explanation) are referred to the following books:

1.  [Essentials of Stochastic Processes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-3615-7) by Rick Durrett (a free version is available at <http://www.math.duke.edu/~rtd/EOSP/EOSP2E.pdf>),

2.  [Adventures in Stochastic Processes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0387-2) by Sidney I. Resnick, 

3.  [Introduction to Probability Models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128143469/introduction-to-probability-models) by Sheldon Ross.

**Online resources.** 

1. **Zoom** will be used for all classes and for office hours. Videos of all zoom sessions (except for private meetings) will be accessible to all students via Canvas. They will include transcripts of the lectures and chat logs. 

2. The course-management system **Canvas** will be used in this course to keep track of grades, serve as a repository of links to other resources and to relay various announcements. The students are responsible for the contents of these announcements. The easiest way not to miss any is to turn on (i.e. not turn off) *Announcements* in their account's *Notification* menu. 

3. This term we will be using **Piazza** for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Find our class signup link at: <https://piazza.com/utexas/fall2020/53875>

4. A set of **online lecture notes** written by the instructor will be provided to students; you can access them at <https://gordanz.github.io/M362M>
These notes will include numbered problems, some of which will be featured in 
hw assignments. All course materials will be available on **Github** in the public repository <https://github.com/gordanz/M362M>. If you don't know what Github is, or if you simply do not want to use it, don't worry; everything will be linked to in Canvas.

**Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited.** No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course. 




------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assessment and grading

**Short quizzes.** A short Canvas quiz will be assigned in parallel with each reading assignment. Their primary purpose is to make sure you read and understood the assigned material. Two lowest quiz scores will be dropped. 

**Homework assignments.** A weekly or bi-weekly homework will be assigned (with the assignments
posted on Canvas). The submission will be **electronic**, through
Canvas. Detailed instructions on the proper format of your submissions 
will be posted in due time (we need to cover a little bit of R before that).
Submit well before the deadline - the system has been known to get "overwhelmed"
close to it. If everything else fails, send your file(s) directly to
the instructor (before the deadline!) with a detailed explanation of the
difficulties you experienced. Late hw will not be accepted.

You are allowed (and, in fact, encouraged) to work on your homework in groups of up to 4 people, 
and to submit a single document per group.  Do not forget to include the names of all group members.
Two lowest hw scores will be dropped.


**Exams.** In addition to short quizzes, there will be three longer exams. All exams will be "take-home" and "open-notes" and will consist of a mix of theoretical and programming questions. Exams will be posted on Canvas and you will get a 24-hour period for each of them. Be prepared to set aside an uninterrupted two hours to complete and upload the exam. The exams will be submitted via Canvas.  The schedule is as follows:

1.  **In-term 1** : Oct 1
2.  **In-term 2** : Nov 12
3.  **In-term 3** : Dec 12

If you miss an exam *for a documented reason* (illness, approved and
previously announced religious holiday, or some other extraordinary
circumstance), make-up arrangements will be made on a case-by-case
basis.

**Extra credit.** Each of the following will earn you some extra credit. Note that the most you can get is 15%. 

 - **2%** : if you give a correct answer to a student question on Piazza. The instructor will choose the best among all the answers, and assign its author 2%. The instructor reserved the right not to assign any extra credit is the question is not meaningful or too easy, or is none of the answers is correct and/or complete. Each student can accumulate at most 6% extra credit this way.
 
 - **1%**: for each topic suggestion made on Piazza. As above, at most one person may get credit for a given suggestion, and the instructor will be the final arbiter of what deserves a point and what does not. Each student can accumulate at most 4% extra credit this way. 

 - **5%**: if you submit all your homework in R markdown (you will learn more about it in class). This includes both theoretical and programming questions. 

**Final grade.** The final grade is composed as follows:

|      Assignment      | Percentage of final grade |
|--------------------- |---------------------------|
| Quizzes              |           15%             |
| Homework             |           25%             |
| Exams                |      60% (20% each)       |

There is *no curve* in this class and the letter grades are assigned
according to the following table:

A | A-|  B+  | B | B- |  C+ | C | C- | D+ | D |  D- | F
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
94 - 100| 90-94 |  86 - 90 |  83 - 86 | 80 - 83 | 75 - 80 | 70 - 75 | 65 - 70 | 60 - 65 | 55 - 60 | 50 - 55 | 0 - 50

### GENERAL, UNIVERSITY- or STATE-MANDATED INFORMATION

**Class Recordings.**  Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

**Drop dates.** The procedure/consequences are different, depending on whether you drop
before or after the 12th day of classes (09/11), and then, before or
after the *main drop (Q-drop) date* (10/29). (See
<https://ugs.utexas.edu/vick/academic/adddrop> for details)


**Academic (dis)Honesty.** Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject
to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the
course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further
information, please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity
website at: <http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct>


**Students with Disabilities.** The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. If you
have a documented disability and you need special treatment as a result
of your disability, please let me know as soon as possible, but
definitely within the first 3 weeks of class. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 (TTY),
1-866-329- 3986 (video phone) or go to
<http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/>


**Religious holy days.** Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination
schedules. Sections 51.911 and 51.925 of the Texas Education Code relate
to absences by students and instructors for observance of religious holy
days.

Section 51.911 states that a student who misses an examination, work
assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy
day must be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a
reasonable time after the absence, provided that he or she has properly
notified each instructor.

It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the student
must notify each instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes
scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy
day. For religious holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the
semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the semester.
The student may not be penalized for these excused absences but the
instructor may appropriately respond if the student fails to complete
satisfactorily the missed assignment or examination within a reasonable
time after the excused absence.


**Counseling and mental health.** Counseling and other mental-health services are available from
**Counseling and Mental Health Center**, Student Services Bldg (SSB),
5th Floor. (hours: M--F 8am--5pm. phone: 512 471 3515, web:
<http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu>)


**Sanger Learning Center.** All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center's classes
and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic
coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject
areas. For more information, please visit
