<p>In the spirit of “learn by doing”, these lecture notes are composed mostly of problems. Those with solutions usually introduce new concepts and feature a <em>Comments</em> section right after the solution. These comments are subdivided into <em>R</em> and <em>Math</em> comments focusing on the computational or coneceptual features, respectively. Note that you are not expected to be able to do the solved problems before reading their solutions and comments, so don’t worry if you cannot. It is a good practice to try, though. Problems unsolved in these notes, however, do not feature any new ideas and are there to help you practice the skills presented before.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p><em>R:</em> R makes it very easy to simulate draws from one of the <em>named</em> distributions, such as geometric, binomial, uniform, normal, etc. For a list of all available distributions, run <code>help(&quot;distributions&quot;)</code> Each available distribution has an <em>R name</em>; the uniform is <code>unif</code> the normal is <code>norm</code> and the binomial is <code>binom</code>, etc. If you want to simulate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> draws (aka a <em>sample</em> of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) from a distribution, you form a full command by appending the letter <code>r</code> to its R name and use <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as an argument. That is how we arrived to <code>rgeom(50)</code> in the solution above. The additional arguments of <code>rgeom</code> have to do with the parameters of that distribution. Which parameters go with which distributions, and how to input them as arguments to <code>rgeom</code> or <code>rnorm</code> is best looked up in R’s extensive documentation. Try <code>help(&quot;rnorm&quot;)</code>, for example.</p>
<em>Math:</em> You might have encountered a geometric distribution before. A random variable with that distribution can take any positive integer value or <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. As you can see from the output above, the value <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> appears more often than the value <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and the value <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> does not appear at all. The probability of seeing the value <span class="math inline">\(k\in \{0,1,2,3,\dots\}\)</span> as a result of a single draw is given by <span class="math inline">\((1-p)^k p\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is called the <em>parameter</em> of the distribution. That corresponds to the following interpretation of the geometric distribution: <em>keep tossing a biased coin (with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of obtaining H) until you see the first H; the number of tosses yielding T before that is your geometric random variable</em>.
If we put these probabilities in a single table (and choose <span class="math inline">\(p=0.4\)</span>, for example) it is going to look like this:

<p>Of course, the possible values our random variable can take do not stop at <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. In fact, there are infinitely many possible values, but we do not have infinite space. Note that, even though, the value <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> does not appear in the output of the command <code>rgeom</code> above, it probably would if we simulated more than <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> values.

</div>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> First, we compute the probability that the value seen in a <em>single</em> draw does not exceed <span class="math inline">\(22\)</span>:</p>

<p><em>R.</em> The command we used here is <code>pgeom</code> which is a cousin of <code>rgeom</code>. In general R commands that involve named probability distributions consist of two parts. The prefix, i.e., the initial letter (<code>p</code> in this case) stands for the operation you want to perform, and the rest is the R name of the distribution. There are 4 prefixes, and the commands they produce are</p>

<p>(see the Math section below for the reminder of what these things are. ) In this problem, we are dealing with a geometric random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, which has a discrete distribution, with support <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,3,\dots\)</span>. Therefore, the R name is <code>geom</code>. We are interested in the probability <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[ X\leq 22]\)</span>, which corresponds to the cdf of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x=22\)</span>, so we use the
the prefix <code>p</code>. Finally, we used the named parameter <code>p</code> and gave it the value <code>p = 0.4</code>, because the geometric distribution has a single parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>This problem also gives us a chance to discuss precision. As you can see, the probability of a single draw not exceeding <span class="math inline">\(22\)</span> is very close to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. In fact, it is equal to it to 5 decimal places. By default, R displays 7 significant digits of a number. That is enough for most applications, but sometimes we need more precision. For example, let’s try to compute the probability of seeing no T (tails) in 10 tosses of a biased coin, where the probability of H (heads) is 0.9.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="dv">1</span><span class="fl">-0.1</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="dv">10</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#R&gt; [1] 1</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>While small, this probability is clearly not equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, as suggested by the output above.
The culprit is the default precision. We can increase the precision (up to <span class="math inline">\(22\)</span> digits) by running <code>options(digits=14)</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">options</span>(<span class="dt">digits=</span><span class="dv">17</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="dv">1</span><span class="fl">-0.1</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="dv">10</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#R&gt; [1] 0.99999999989999999</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Problems like this should not appear in this course, but they will out there “in the wild”, so it might be a good idea to be aware of them.</p>
<p><em>Math.</em> If you forgot all about pdfs, cdfs and such things here is a little reminder:
And here is a reminder what these quantities are:</p>

<p>Those random variables that admit a pdf are called <strong>continuous</strong>. The prime examples are the normal, or the exponential distribution. The ones where a pmf exists are called <strong>discrete</strong>. The sequence <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> is simply the sequence of all values that such a, discrete, random variable can take. Most often, <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> is either the set of all natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,\dots\)</span> or a finite subset such that <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,3,4,5\)</span>, called the <strong>support</strong> of the distribution.</p>
<p>Btw, this probability we obtained is quite small. Since <span class="math inline">\(1/0.000372\)</span> is about <span class="math inline">\(2690\)</span>, we would have to run about <span class="math inline">\(2690\)</span> rounds of <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span> simulations before the largest number falls below <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>R.</em> The function we used is <code>qnorm</code>, with the prefix <code>q</code> which computes the quantile function and the R name <code>norm</code> because we are looking for the quantiles of the normal distribution. The additinal (named) parameters are where the parameters of the distribution come in (the mean and the standard variation) in this case. Note how we plugged in the entire vector <code>c(0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 0.98)</code> instead of a single value into <code>qnorm</code>. You can do that because this function is <strong>vectorized</strong>. That means that if you give it a vector as an argument, it will return a vector with values corresponding to each element of the input. Many (but not all) functions in R are vectorized.</p>
<p>As a sanity check, let’s apply the cdf to these quantile values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1">p &lt;-<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">qnorm</span>( <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="fl">0.05</span>, <span class="fl">0.1</span>, <span class="fl">0.4</span>, <span class="fl">0.6</span>, <span class="fl">0.95</span>), <span class="dt">mean =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">sd =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</a>

<p>As expected, we got the original values back - the normal quantile function and its cdf are inverses of each other.</p>

<p><em>R.</em> The command used to draw a sample from a (finite) collection is, of, course <code>sample</code>. The first argument is a vector, and it contains the “bag” from which you are drawing. If we are interested in repeated, random samples, we also need to specity <code>replace = FALSE</code> otherwise, you could draw any signle number am most once:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#R&gt; [1]  1  5  6  7  8 10  3  4</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>With more than 10 draws, we would run out of numbers to draw:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a>

<p>The bag you draw from can contain objects other than numbers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">sample</span>( <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Alice&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Bob&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Charlie&quot;</span>), <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#R&gt; [1] &quot;Charlie&quot; &quot;Bob&quot;     &quot;Alice&quot;   &quot;Charlie&quot; &quot;Bob&quot;     &quot;Charlie&quot; &quot;Charlie&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#R&gt; [8] &quot;Charlie&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
So far, each object in the bag had the same probability of being drawn. You can use the <code>sample</code> command to produce a <em>weighted</em> sample, too. For example, if we wanted to simulate <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> draws from the following distribution

<p><em>R.</em> It cannot be simpler! You use the command <code>hist</code>, feed it a vector of values, and it produces a histogram. It will even labels the axes. If you want to learn how to tweak various features of your histogram, type <code>?hist</code>.</p>
<p>Esthetically, the built-in histograms leave something to be desired. We can do better, using the package <code>ggplot2</code>. You don’t have to use it in this class, but if you want to, you install it first by running <code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code> (you have to do this only once). Then, every time you want to use it, you run <code>library(ggplot2)</code> to notify R that you are aobut to use a function from that package. It would take a whole semester to learn everything there is to know about <code>ggplot2</code>; I will only show what a histogram looks like in it:</p>

<em>Math</em>. Mathematically, histogram can be produced for any (finite) sequence of numbers: we divide the range into several bins, count how many of the points in the sequence falls into which bin, and then draw a bar above that bin whose height is equal (or proportional to) that count. The picture tells use about how the sequence we started from is “distributed”. The order of the points does not matter - you would get exactly the same picture if you presorted the points. If the sequence of points you draw the histogram comes from, say, normal distribution, the histogram will resemble the shape of the pdf of a normal distribution. I say resemble, because its shape is ultimately random. If the number of points is small (like in the second part of this problem) the histogram may look nothing like the normal pdf. However, when the number of points gets larger and larger, the shape of the histogram gets closer and closer to the underlying pdf (if it exists). I keep writing “shape” because the the three histograms above have very different scales on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis. That is because we used counts to set the sizes of bins. A more natural choice is to use the proportions, i.e. relative frequencies (i.e. counts divided by the total number of points) for bar heights. In R, we would need to add an additional option to <code>hist</code>:</p>

<p>With such a normalization, the histogram of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can be directly compared to the probability density of a normal distribution. Here is a picture. Its R code is a little bit too advanced for now, so I am skipping it:</p>

<p><em>R.</em> The only new thing here is the command <code>mean</code> which computes the mean of vector.</p>
<p><em>Math.</em> There is a lot going on here conceptually. This is the first time we used the Monte Carlo method. It is an incredibly method, as you will keep being reminded throughout this class. The idea behind it is simple, and it is based on the <em>Law of large numbers</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(X_1,X_2, \dots\)</span> be an independent sequence of random variables with the same distribution, for which the expected value can be computed. Then
<span class="math display">\[ \tfrac{1}{n} \Big( X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n\Big) \to {\mathbb{E}}[X_1] \text{ as } n\to\infty\]</span>
The idea behind Monte Carlo is to turn this theorem “upside down”. The goal is to compute <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{E}}[X_1]\)</span>, and uses a supply of random numbers, each of which comes from the same distribution to accomplish that. The random number generator inside <code>rexp</code> gives us a supply of numbers (stored in the vector <code>x</code>) and all we have to do is compute their average. This gives us the left-hand side of the formula above, and, if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large enough, we hope that the this average does not differ too much from its theoretical limit. As <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> gets larger, we expect better and better results. That is why your error above gets smaller as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases.</p>
<p>It looks like Monte Carlo can only be used to compute the expected value of a random variable, which does not seem like such a bit deal. It is! You will see in the sequel that almost anything can be written as the expected value of <em>some</em> random variable.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<span id="exr:unnamed-chunk-39" class="exercise"><strong>Problem 2.7  </strong></span>Use Monte Carlo to estimate <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{E}}[X^2]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a standard normal random variable.

<p><em>Math+R.</em> We are asked to compute <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{E}}[ X^2]\)</span>, which can be interpreted in two ways. First, we can think of <span class="math inline">\(Y=X^2\)</span> as a random variable in its own and try to take draws from the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the case of the normal distribution, the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is known - it happens to be a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>-distribution with a single degree of freedom (don’t worry if you never heard of it). We can simulate it in R by using its R name <code>chisq</code> and
get a number close to the exact value of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The case of a geometric distribution is seemingly more difficult, because we do not know what the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y=X^2\)</span> is and there is no corresponding R name to put the prefix <code>r</code> in front of. What makes the simulation possible is the fact that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a <em>transformation</em> of
a random variable we know how to simulate. In that case, we simply simulate the required number of draws <code>x</code> from the geometric distribution (using <code>rgeom</code>) and then apply the transformation <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto x^2\)</span> to the result. The transformed vector <code>y</code> is then nothing but the sequence of draws from the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X^2\)</span>. Btw, we could have done the same thing in the case of the normal random variable, too - there was no need to recoqnize its square as a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> random variable:</p>

<p>The idea described above is one of main advantages of the Monte Carlo technique: if you know how to simulated a random variable, you also know how to simulated any (deterministic) function of it. That fact will come into its own a bit later when we start working with several random variables and stochastic processes, but it can be very helpful even in the case of a single random variable, as you will see in the next problem.</p>
