You might want to peek ahead as notions are being introduced; it will help your understanding. 1.1 The Communication Relation Let \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\) be a Markov chain on the state space \\(S\\). For a given set \\(B\\) of states, define the (first) hitting time \\(\\tau_B\\) (or \\(\\tau(B)\\) if subscripts are impractical) of the set \\(B\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tau_B=\\min \\{ n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}_0\\, : \\, X_n\\in B\\}. \\end{equation}\\] We know that \\(\\tau_B\\) is, in fact, a stopping time with respect to \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\). When \\(B\\) consists of only one element , e.g. \\(B=\\{i\\}\\), we simply write \\(\\tau_{i}\\) for \\(\\tau_{\\{i\\}}\\); \\(\\tau_{i}\\) is the first time the Markov chain \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\) “hits” the state \\(i\\). As always, we allow \\(\\tau_{B}\\) to take the value \\(\\infty\\); it means that no state in \\(B\\) is ever hit. The hitting times are important both for applications, and for better understanding of the structure of Markov chains in general. For example, let \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\) be the chain which models a game of tennis (from the previous lecture). The probability of winning for Player 1 can be phrased in terms of hitting times: \\[{\\mathbb{P}}[ \\text{Player 1 wins}]={\\mathbb{P}}[ \\tau_{i_{1}}&lt;\\tau_{i_{2}}],\\] where \\(i_{1}=\\) “Player 1 wins” and \\(i_{2}=\\)“Player 2 wins” (the two absorbing states of the chain). We will learn how to compute such probabilities in the subsequent lectures. Having introduced the hitting times \\(\\tau_B\\), let us give a few more definitions. It will be very convenient to consider the same Markov chain with different initial distributions. Most often, these distributions will correspond to starting from a fixed state (as opposed to choosing the initial state at random). We use the notation \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[A]\\) to mean \\({\\mathbb{P}}[A|X_0=i]\\) (for any event \\(A\\)), and \\({\\mathbb{E}}_i[A]={\\mathbb{E}}[A|X_0=i]\\) (for any random variable \\(X\\)). In practice, we use \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i\\) and \\({\\mathbb{E}}_i\\) to signify that we are starting the chain from the state \\(i\\), i.e., \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i\\) corresponds to a Markov chain whose transition matrix is the same as the one of \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\), but the initial distribution is given by \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[X_0=j]=0\\) if \\(j\\not = i\\) and \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[X_0=i]=1\\). Note also that \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[X_1=j] = p_{ij}\\) and that \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[X_n=j] =p^{(n)}_{ij}\\), for any \\(n\\). A state \\(i\\in S\\) is said to communicate with the state \\(j\\in S\\), denoted by \\(i\\to j\\) if \\[{\\mathbb{P}}_i[\\tau_{j}&lt;\\infty]&gt;0.\\] Intuitively, \\(i\\) communicates with \\(j\\) if there is a non-zero chance that the Markov chain \\(X\\) will eventually visit \\(j\\) if it starts from \\(i\\). Sometimes we also say that \\(j\\) is a consequent of \\(i\\), that \\(j\\) is accessible from \\(i\\), or that \\(j\\) follows \\(i\\). In the “tennis” example of the previous chapter, every state is accessible from \\((0,0)\\) (the fact that \\(p\\in (0,1)\\) is important here), but \\((0,0)\\) is not accessible from any other state. The consequents of \\((0,0)\\) are not only \\((15,0)\\) and \\((0,15)\\), but also \\((30,15)\\) or \\((40,40)\\). In fact, all states are consequents of \\((0,0)\\). The consequents of \\((40,40)\\) are \\((40,40)\\) itself, \\((40,Adv)\\), \\((Adv, 40)\\), “P1 wins” and “P2 wins”. Explain why \\(i \\to j\\) if and only if \\(p^{(n)}_{ij}&gt;0\\) for some \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}_0\\). Leaving a rigorous mathematical proof aside, we note that the statement is intuitively easy to understand. If \\(i\\to j\\) then there must exist some time \\(n\\) such that \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[\\tau_j = n]&gt;0\\). This, in turn, implies that it is possible to go from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\) in exactly \\(n\\) steps, where “possible” means “with positive probability”. In our notation, that is exactly what \\(p^{(n)}_{ij}&gt;0\\) means. Conversely, if \\(p^{(n)}_{ij}&gt;0\\) then \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[ \\tau_j &lt;\\infty] \\geq {\\mathbb{P}}_i[\\tau_j \\leq n] \\geq {\\mathbb{P}}_i[ X_n = j]=p^{(n)}_{ij}&gt;0.\\) Two immediate properties of the relation \\(\\to\\) are listed in the problem below: Explain why the following statements are true for all states \\(i,j,k\\) of a Markov chain. \\(i\\to i\\), \\(i\\to j, j\\to k\\) implies \\(i \\to k\\). If we start from state \\(i\\in S\\) we are already there! More rigorously, note that \\(0\\) is allowed as a value for \\(\\tau_{B}\\) in its definition above, i.e., \\(\\tau_i=0\\) when \\(X_0=i\\). Intuitively, if you can follow a path (sequence of arrows) from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), and then another path \\(j\\) to \\(k\\), you can do the same from \\(i\\) to \\(k\\) by concatenating two paths. More rigorously, by the previous problem, it will be enough to show that \\(p^{(n)}_{ik}&gt;0\\) for some \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). By the same Proposition, we know that \\(p^{(n_1)}_{ij}&gt;0\\) and \\(p^{(n_2)}_{jk}&gt;0\\) for some \\(n_1,n_2\\in{\\mathbb{N}}_0\\). By the Chapman-Kolmogorov relations, with \\(n=n_1+n_2\\), we have \\[\\begin{equation} p^{(n)}_{ik} =\\sum_{l\\in S} p^{(n_1)}_{il} p^{(n_2)}_{lk}\\geq p^{(n_1)}_{ij} p^{(n_2)}_{jk}&gt;0. \\end{equation}\\] Note that the inequality \\(p^{(n)}_{ik}\\geq p^{(n_1)}_{il}p^{(n_2)}_{lk}\\) is valid for all \\(i,l,k\\in S\\), as long as \\(n_1+n_2=n\\). It will come in handy later. Remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set \\(A\\) of natural numbers if the largest number \\(d\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\) such that \\(d\\) divides each \\(k\\in A\\), i.e., such that each \\(k\\in A\\) is of the form \\(k=l d\\) for some \\(l\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). A period \\(d(i)\\) of a state \\(i\\in S\\) is the greatest common divisor of the return set \\[R(i)= \\{ n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\, : \\, p^{(n)}_{ii}&gt;0\\}\\] of the state \\(i\\). When \\(R(i)=\\emptyset\\), we set \\(d(i)=1\\). A state \\(i\\in S\\) is called aperiodic if \\(d(i)=1\\). Consider two Markov chains with three states and the transition matrices \\[P_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad P_2=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\tfrac{1}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \\tfrac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}\\] Find return sets and periods of each state \\(i\\) of each chain. For the first chain, with transition graph the return set for each state \\(i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\) is given by \\(R(i)= \\{3,6,9,12,\\dots\\}\\), so \\(d(i)=3\\) for all \\(i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\). Even though the transition graph of the second chain looks very similar to the first one the situation changes drastically: \\[\\begin{align} R(1) &amp; =\\{ 3,4,5,6, \\dots \\},\\\\ R(2) &amp; =\\{ 2,3,4,5,6, \\dots \\},\\\\ R(3) &amp; =\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6, \\dots \\}, \\end{align}\\] so that \\(d(i)=1\\) for \\(i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\). 1.2 Classes We say that the states \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) in \\(S\\) intercommunicate, denoted by \\(i\\leftrightarrow j\\) if \\(i\\to j\\) and \\(j\\to i\\). A set \\(B\\subseteq S\\) of states is called irreducible if \\(i\\leftrightarrow j\\) for all \\(i,j\\in S\\). Unlike the relation of communication, the relation of intercommunication is symmetric. Moreover, we have the following immediate property: the relation \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(S\\), i.e., for all \\(i,j,k\\in S\\), we have \\(i\\leftrightarrow i\\) (reflexivity) , \\(i\\leftrightarrow j\\) implies \\(j\\leftrightarrow i\\) (symmetry), and \\(i\\leftrightarrow j, j\\leftrightarrow k\\) implies \\(i\\leftrightarrow k\\) (transitivity). The fact that \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) is an equivalence relation allows us to split the state-space \\(S\\) into equivalence classes with respect to \\(\\leftrightarrow\\). In other words, we can write \\[S=S_1\\cup S_2\\cup S_3\\cup \\dots,\\] where \\(S_1, S_2, \\dots\\) are mutually exclusive (disjoint) and all states in a particular \\(S_n\\) intercommunicate, while no two states from different equivalence classes \\(S_n\\) and \\(S_m\\) do. The sets \\(S_1, S_2, \\dots\\) are called classes of the chain \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\). Equivalently, one can say that classes are maximal irreducible sets, in the sense that they are irreducible and no class is a subset of a (strictly larger) irreducible set. A cookbook algorithm for class identification would involve the following steps: Start from an arbitrary state (call it \\(1\\)). Identify all states \\(j\\) that intercommunicate with it (\\(1\\), itself, always does). That is your first class, call it \\(C_1\\). If there are no elements left, then there is only one class \\(C_1=S\\). If there is an element in \\(S\\setminus C_1\\), repeat the procedure above starting from that element. The notion of a class is especially useful in relation to another natural concept: A set \\(B\\subseteq S\\) of states is said to be closed if \\(i \\not\\to j\\) for all \\(i\\in B\\) and all \\(j\\in S\\setminus B\\). In words, \\(B\\) is closed if it is impossible to get out of. A state \\(i\\in S\\) such that the set \\(\\{i\\}\\) is closed is called absorbing. Show that a set \\(B\\) of states is closed if and only if \\(p_{ij}=0\\) for all \\(i\\in B\\) and all \\(j\\in B^c=S\\setminus B\\). Suppose, first, that \\(B\\) is closed. Then for \\(i\\in B\\) and \\(j\\in B^c\\), we have \\(i\\not\\to j\\), i.e., \\(p^{(n)}_{ij}=0\\) for all \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). In particular, \\(p_{ij}=0\\). Conversely, suppose that \\(p_{ij}=0\\) for all \\(i\\in B\\), \\(j\\in B^c\\). We need to show that \\(k\\not\\to l\\) (i.e. \\(p^{(n)}_{kl}=0\\) for all \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\)) for all \\(k\\in B\\), \\(l\\in B^c\\). Suppose, to the contrary, that there exist \\(k\\in B\\) and \\(l\\in B^c\\) such that \\(p^{(n)}_{kl}&gt;0\\) for some \\(n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}\\). That means that we can find a sequence of states \\[k=i_0, i_1, \\dots, i_n=l \\text{ such that } p_{i_{m-1} i_{m}}&gt;0 \\text{ forall }m = 1,\\dots, n.\\] The first state, \\(k=i_0\\) is in \\(B\\) and the last one, \\(l=i_n\\), is in \\(B^c\\). Therefore there must exist an index \\(m\\) such that \\(i_{m-1}\\in B\\) but \\(i_{m}\\in B^c\\). We also know that \\(p_{i_m i_{m+1}}&gt;0\\), which is in contradiction with out assumption that \\(p_{ij}=0\\) for all \\(i\\in B\\) and \\(j\\in B^c\\). Intuitively, a set of states is closed if it has the property that the chain \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\) stays in it forever, once it enters it. In general, if \\(B\\) is closed, it does not have to follow that \\(S\\setminus B\\) is closed. Also, a class does not have to be closed, and a closed set does not have to be a class. Here is an example - consider the following three sets of states in the tennis chain of the previous lecture and: \\(B=\\{\\text{``P1 wins&#39;&#39;}\\}\\): closed and a class, but \\(S\\setminus B\\) is not closed \\(B=S\\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\): closed, but not a class, and \\(B=\\{(0,0)\\}\\): class, but not closed. Not everything is lost as the following relationship always holds: Show that every closed set \\(B\\) is a union of one or more classes. Let \\(\\hat{B}\\) be the union of all classes \\(C\\) such that \\(C\\cap B\\not=\\emptyset\\). In other words, take all the elements of \\(B\\) and throw in all the states which intercommunicate with at least one of them. I claim that \\(\\hat{B}=B\\). Clearly, \\(B\\subset \\hat{B}\\), so we need to show that \\(\\hat{B}\\subseteq B\\). Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists \\(j\\in \\hat{B}\\setminus B\\). By construction, \\(j\\) intercommunicates with some \\(i\\in B\\). In particular \\(i\\to j\\). By the closedness of \\(B\\), we must have \\(j\\in B\\). This is a contradiction with the assumptions that \\(j\\in \\hat{B}\\setminus B\\). Note that the converse is not true: ust take the set \\(B=\\{ (0,0), (0,15)\\}\\) in the “tennis” example. It is a union of two classes, but it is not closed. 1.3 Transience and recurrence It is often important to know whether a Markov chain will ever return to its initial state, and if so, how often. The notions of transience and recurrence are used to address this questions. We start by introducing a cousin \\(T_j(1)\\) of the first hitting time \\(\\tau_1\\). The (first) visit time to state \\(j\\), denoted by \\(T_j(1)\\) is defined as \\[T_j(1) = \\min \\{ n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\, : \\, X_n=j\\}.\\] As usual \\(T_j(1)=\\infty\\) if \\(X_n\\not = j\\) for all \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). Similarly, second, third, etc., visit times are defined as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} T_j(2) &amp;= \\min \\{ n&gt;T_j(1)\\, : \\, X_n=j\\}, \\\\ T_j(3) &amp;= \\min \\{ n&gt;T_j(2)\\, : \\, X_n=j\\}, \\text{ etc., }\\end{aligned}\\] with the understanding that if \\(T_j(n)=\\infty\\), then also \\(T_j(m)=\\infty\\) for all \\(m&gt;n\\). Note that the definition of the random variable \\(T_j(1)\\) differs from the definition of \\(\\tau_j\\) in that the minimum here is taken over the set \\({\\mathbb{N}}\\) of natural numbers, while the set of non-negative integers \\({\\mathbb{N}}_0\\) is used for \\(\\tau_j\\). When \\(X_0\\not = j\\), the hitting time \\(\\tau_j\\) and the first visit time \\(T_j(1)\\) coincide. The important difference occurs only when \\(X_0=j\\). In that case \\(\\tau_j=0\\) (we are already there), but it is always true that \\(T_j(1)\\geq 1\\). It can even happen that \\({\\mathbb{P}}_j[T_j(1)=\\infty]=1\\). If you want an example, take any state in the deterministically monotone chain. A state \\(i\\in S\\) is said to be recurrent if \\({\\mathbb{P}}_i[T_i(1)&lt;\\infty]=1\\), positive recurrent if \\({\\mathbb{E}}_i[T_i(1)]&lt;\\infty\\) null recurrent if it is recurrent, but not positive recurrent, transient if it is not recurrent. A state is recurrent if we are sure we will come back to it eventually (with probability 1). It is positive recurrent if it is recurrent and the time between two consecutive visits has finite expectation. Null recurrence means the we will return, but the waiting time may be very long. A state is transient if there is a positive chance (however small) that the chain will never return to it. 1.3.1 The Return Theorem The definition of recurrence from above is conceptually simple, but it gives us no clue about how to actually go about deciding whether a particular state in a specific Markov chain is recurrent. A criterion stated entirely in terms of the transition matrix \\(P\\) would be nice. Before we give it, we need to introduce some notation. and prove an important theorem. Given a state \\(i\\), let \\(f_i\\) denote the probability that the chain will visit \\(i\\) again, if it starts there, i.e., \\[f_i = {\\mathbb{P}}_i[ T_i(1) &lt; \\infty].\\] Clearly, \\(i\\) is recurrent if and only if \\(f_i=1\\). The interesting thing is that every time our chain visits the state \\(i\\), its future evolution is independent from the past (except for the name of the current state) and it behaves exactly like a new and independent chain started from \\(i\\) would. This is a special case of so-called strong Markov property which states that the (usual) Markov property also holds at stopping times (and not only fixed times \\(n\\)). We will not prove this property it these notes, but we will gladly use it to prove the following dichotomy: Theorem 1.1 (The “Return” Theorem) Let \\(\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0}\\) be a Markov chain on a countable state space \\(S\\), with the (deterministic) initial state \\(X_0=i\\). Then exactly one of the following two statements hold: either the chain will return to \\(i\\) infinitely many times, or the chain will return to \\(i\\) a finite number \\(N_i\\) of times, where \\(N_i\\) is geometrically distributed random variable with parameter \\(f_i\\), where \\(f_i={\\mathbb{P}}_i[T_i(1)&lt;\\infty]\\). In the first case, \\(i\\) is recurrent and, in the second, it is transient. Proof. If \\(f_i=1\\), then \\(X\\) is guaranteed to return to \\(i\\) at least once. When that happens, however, the strong Markov property “deletes” the past, and the process “renews” itself. This puts us back in the original situation where we are looking at a chain which starts at \\(i\\) and is guaranteed to return there at least once. Continuing like that, we get a whole infinite sequence of stopping times \\[T_i(1) &lt; T_i(2) &lt; \\dots\\] at which \\(X\\) finds itself at \\(i\\). If \\(f_i&lt;1\\), a similar story can be told, but with a significant difference. Every time \\(X\\) returns to \\(i\\), there is a probability \\(1-f_i\\) that it will never come back to \\(i\\), and, this is independent of the past behavior. If we think of the return to \\(i\\) as a success, the number of successes before the first failure, i.e., the number of return visits to \\(i\\), is nothing but a geometrically distributed random variable with parameter \\(f_i\\). Q.E.D. The following interesting fact follows (almost) directly from the Return Theorem: Suppose that the state space \\(S\\) is finite. Show that there exists at least one recurrent state. We argue by contradiction and assume that all the states are transient. We claim that, in that case, the total number of visits \\(N_i\\) to each state \\(i\\) is always finite, no matter what state \\(i_0\\) we start from. Indeed, if \\(i=i_0\\) that is precisely the conclusion the Return Theorem above. For a state \\(i\\ne i_0\\), the number of visits is either \\(0\\) - if we never even get to \\(i\\), or \\(1+N_{i}\\) if we do. In either case, it is a finite number (not \\(\\infty\\)). Therefore the sum \\(\\sum_{i\\in S} N_i\\) is also finite - a contradiction with the fact that there are infinitely many time instances \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}_0\\), and that the chain must be in some state in each one of them. If \\(S\\) is not finite, it is not true that recurrent states must exist. Just think of the Deterministically-Monotone Chain or the random walk with \\(p\\not=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\). All states are transitive there. 1.3.2 A recurrence criterion Perhaps the most important consequence of the Return Theorem is the following criterion for recurrence of Markov chains on finite or countable state spaces: Theorem 1.2 (The Recurrence Criterion) A state \\(i\\in S\\) is recurrent if and only if \\[\\sum_{n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}} p^{(n)}_{ii}=\\infty.\\] Proof. Let \\(N_i\\) denote the total number (finite or \\(\\infty\\)) of visits to the state \\(i\\), with the initial visit at time \\(0\\) not counted. We can write \\(N_i\\) as an infinite sum as follows \\[N_i = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_n = i\\}}.\\] Taking the expectation yields \\[{\\mathbb{E}}[N_i] = {\\mathbb{E}}_i[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_n=i\\}}] = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {\\mathbb{E}}_i[ \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_n=i\\}}] = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {\\mathbb{P}}_i[ X_n=i] = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p^{(n)}_{ii},\\] where we used the intuitively acceptable (but not rigorously proven) fact that \\({\\mathbb{E}}_i\\) and an infinite sum can be switched. If \\(i\\) is transient, i.e., if \\(f_i&lt;1\\), the Return Theorem and the formula for the expected value of a geometric distribution imply that \\[{\\mathbb{E}}_i[N_i] = \\frac{f_i}{1-f_i}&lt;\\infty, \\text{ and so } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p^{(n)}_{ii} = {\\mathbb{E}}_i[N_i]&lt;\\infty.\\] On the other hand, if \\(i\\) is recurrent, the Return Theorem states that \\(N_i=\\infty\\). Hence, \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p^{(n)}_{ii}={\\mathbb{E}}_i[N_i]=\\infty. \\text{ Q.E.D. }\\] Remark. The central idea behind the proof of the recurrence criterion is the following: we managed tell whether or not \\(N_i = \\infty\\) by checking whether \\({\\mathbb{E}}[N_i]=\\infty\\) or not. This is, however, not something that can be done for any old random variable taking values in \\({\\mathbb{N}}_0 \\cup \\{\\infty\\}\\). If \\({\\mathbb{E}}[N]&lt;\\infty\\), then, clearly \\({\\mathbb{P}}[N=\\infty]=0\\) so that \\(N\\) only takes values in \\({\\mathbb{N}}_0\\). On the other hand, it is not true that \\({\\mathbb{P}}[N=\\infty]=0\\) implies that \\({\\mathbb{E}}[N]&lt;\\infty\\). It suffices to take a random variable with the following distribution \\[{\\mathbb{P}}[ N = n] = c/n^2 \\text{ for }n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},\\] where the constant \\(c\\) is chosen so that \\(\\sum_n c/n^2 =1\\) (in fact, we can compute that \\(c=6/\\pi^2\\) explicitly in this case). The expected value of \\(N\\) is given by \\[{\\mathbb{E}}[N] = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n {\\mathbb{P}}[N=n] = c \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = \\infty.\\] The message is that, in general, you cannot detect whether something happened infinitely many times or not based only on its expectation. Such a detection, however, becomes possible in the special case when \\(N=N_i\\) denotes the total number of returns to the state \\(i\\) of a Markov chain. This is exactly the content of proof of the Return Theorem above: each time the chain leaves \\(i\\), it comes back to it (or does not) with the same probability, independently of the past. This gives us extra information about the random variable \\(N\\) (namely that it is either infinite with probability \\(1\\) or geometrically distributed) and allows us to test its finiteness by using the expected value only. 1.3.3 Polya’s theorem Here is an application of our recurrence criterion - a beautiful and unexpected result of George Pólya from 1921. In addition to the simple symmetric random walk on the line (\\(d=1\\)) we studied before, one can consider random walks whose values are in the plane (\\(d=2\\)), the space (\\(d=3\\)), etc. These are usually defined as follows: the random walk in \\(d\\) dimensions is the Markov chain with the state space \\(S={\\mathbb{Z}}^d\\) and the following transitions: starting from the state \\((x_1,\\dots, x_d)\\), it picks one of its \\(2d\\) neighbors \\((x_1+1,\\dots, x_d)\\), \\((x_1-1,\\dots, x_d)\\), \\((x_1, x_2+1,\\dots, x_d)\\), \\((x_1, x_2-1,\\dots, x_d)\\), …, \\((x_1,\\dots, x_d+1)\\), \\((x_1,\\dots, x_d-1)\\) randomly and uniformly and moves there. For illustration, here is a picture of a path of a two-dimensional random walk; as time progresses, the color of the edges goes from black to orange, edges traversed multiple times are darker, dots mark the position of the walk at time \\(n=0\\) (the black round dot) and at time \\(n=1000\\) (orange square dot): Polya’s (and our) goal was to study the recurrence properties of the \\(d\\)-dimensional random walk. We already know that the simple symmetric random walk on \\({\\mathbb{Z}}\\) is recurrent (i.e., every \\(i\\in {\\mathbb{Z}}\\) is a recurrent state). The easiest way to proceed when \\(d\\geq 2\\) is to use the recurrence criterion we proved above. We start by estimating the values \\(p^{(n)}_{ii}\\), for \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). By symmetry, we can focus on the origin, i.e., it is enough to estimate, for each \\(n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\), the magnitude of \\[p^{(n)}= p^{(n)}_{00}= {\\mathbb{P}}_{0}[ X_n=(0,0,\\dots, 0)].\\] As we learned some time ago, this probability can be computed by counting all “trajectories” from \\((0,\\dots, 0)\\) that return to \\((0,\\dots, 0)\\) in \\(n\\) steps. First of all, it is clear that \\(n\\) needs to be even, i.e., \\(n=2m\\), for some \\(m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\). It helps if we think of any trajectory as a sequence of “increments” \\(\\xi_1,\\dots, \\xi_n\\), where each \\(\\xi_i\\) takes its value in the set \\(\\{1,-1,2,-2,\\dots, d, -d\\}\\). In words, \\(\\xi_i= +k\\) if the \\(k\\)-th coordinate increases by \\(1\\) on the \\(i\\)-th step, and \\(\\xi_i=-k\\), if the \\(k\\)-th coordinate decreases1 This way, the problem becomes combinatorial: In how many ways can we put one element of the set \\(\\{1,-1,2,-2, \\dots, d,-d\\}\\) into each of \\(n=2m\\) boxes so that the number of boxes with \\(k\\) in them equals to the number of boxes with \\(-k\\) in them? To get the answer, we start by fixing a possible “count” \\((i_1,\\dots, i_d)\\), satisfying \\(i_1+\\dots+i_d=m\\) of the number of times each of the values in \\(\\{1,2,\\dots, d\\}\\) occurs. These values have to be placed in \\(m\\) of the \\(2m\\) slots and their negatives (possibly in a different order) in the remaining \\(m\\) slots. So, first, we choose the “positive” slots (in \\(\\binom{2m}{m}\\) ways), and then distribute \\(i_1\\) “ones”, \\(i_2\\) “twos”, etc., in those slots; this can be done in2 \\[\\binom{ m }{ i_1 i_2 \\dots i_d}\\] ways. This is also the number of ways we can distribute the negative “ones”, “twos”, etc., in the remaining slots. All in all, for fixed \\(i_1,i_2,\\dots, i_d\\), all of this can be done in \\[\\binom{2m}{m} \\binom{ m }{ i_1 i_2 \\dots i_d}^2\\] ways. Remembering that each path has the probability \\((2d)^{-2m}\\), and summing over all \\(i_1,\\dots, i_d\\) with \\(i_1+\\dots+i_d=m\\), we get \\[\\begin{equation} p^{(2m)} = \\frac{1}{(2d)^{2m}} \\binom{2m}{m} \\sum_{i_1+\\dots+i_d=m} \\binom{ m }{ i_1 i_2 \\dots i_d}^2. \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This expression looks so complicated that we better start examining is for particular values of \\(d\\): For \\(d=1\\), the expression above simplifies to \\(p^{(2m)} = \\frac{1}{4^{m}} \\binom{2m}{m}\\). It is still too complicated sum over all \\(m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\), but we can simplify it further by using Stirling’s formula \\[n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n} \\big(\\tfrac{n}{e}\\big)^n,\\] where \\(a_n \\sim b_n\\) means \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n/b_n=1\\). Indeed, from there, \\[\\label{equ:binom} \\begin{split} \\binom{2m}{m} \\sim \\frac{4^m}{ \\sqrt{\\pi m}}, \\end{split} \\text{ and so } p^{(2m)} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m\\pi}}.\\] That means that \\(p^{(m)}\\) behaves li a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p=1/2\\) which we know is divergent. Therefore, \\[\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} p^{(2m)} = \\infty,\\] and we recover our previous conclusion that the simple symmetric random walk is, indeed, recurrent. Moving on to the case \\(d= 2\\), we notice that the sum of the multinomial coefficients in (1.1) no longer equals \\(1\\); in fact it is given by3 \\[\\label{equ:Van} \\begin{split} \\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{i}^2 = \\binom{2m}{m}, \\end{split}\\] and, so, \\[p^{(2m)} = \\frac{1}{16^m} \\Big( \\frac{4^m}{\\sqrt{\\pi m}} \\Big)^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{\\pi m} \\text{ implying that } \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} p^{(2m)}=\\infty,\\] which which, in turn, implies that the two-dimensional random walk is also recurrent. How about \\(d\\geq 3\\)? Things are even more complicated now. The multinomial sum in (1.1) above does not admit a nice closed-form expression as in the case \\(d=2\\), so we need to do some estimates; these are a bit tedious so we skip them, but report the punchline, which is that \\[p^{(2m)} \\sim C \\Big( \\tfrac{3}{m} \\Big)^{3/2},\\] for some constant \\(C\\). This is where it gets interesting: this is a \\(p\\)-series which converges: \\[\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} p^{(2m)}&lt;\\infty,\\] and, so, the random walk is transient for \\(d=3\\). This is enough to conclude that the random walk is transient for all \\(d\\geq 3\\), too (why?). To summarize Theorem 1.3 (Polya) The simple symmetric random walk is recurrent for \\(d=1,2\\), but transient for \\(d\\geq 3\\). In the words of Shizuo Kakutani A drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever. 1.4 Class properties COMING SOON 1.5 A few Examples COMING SOON 1.6 Additional problems for Chapter 6 ⬇︎ In case you were wondering, the text below belongs to footnotes from somewhere high above.⬇︎ For \\(d=2\\) we could have used the values “up”, “down”, “left” and\n“’right”, for \\(1,-1,2\\) or \\(-2\\), respectively.
